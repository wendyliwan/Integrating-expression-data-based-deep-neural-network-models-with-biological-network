# Integrating-expression-data-based-deep-neural-network-models-with-biological-network
DNN models were established to screen out RNAs with significant contribution to the DNN models.
Multiple fully connected DNN models were built with Google TensorFlow 2.0 architecture. The architecture of each fully connected DNN model is composed of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. The output layer with 1/0 label indicates the sample to be a cancer one or not. The Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) optimizer with default parameters supplied by Keras was chosen due to the small sample size. Here, the loss function of binary cross-entropy was used.
Features that contributed significantly to the DNN models were more biologically significant. In this paper, DeepExplainer of the python SHAP module was used to interpret the DNN models. The impact of each feature on each sample was obtained using force_plot. Then the arithmetic average of absolute values for the impact was used to represent the importance of the feature to all samples, denoted as the SHAP value calculated by summary_plot. The larger the SHAP value is, the greater the contribution of the feature to the corresponding DNN model.
